## What kinds of behavior cause sexual harassment?

1. Looking someone up and down or staring in a way that makes them feel uncomfortable.
2. Asking invasive questions about someone's sexual life or preferences.
3. Standing too close, brushing up against someone, or blocking their path.
4. Sending unwanted sexually explicit emails, texts, or social media messages.
5. Any form of inappropriate touching, groping, hugging, or kissing.

## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behavior?

1. I will clearly communicate to the harasser that their behavior is unwelcome and must stop.
2. I will talk to someone I trust about what happened. It could be a friend, family member, or a colleague.
3. I will write down my account of what happened, including details such as dates, times, and what was said or done.
4. I will report the harassment to my employer or the designated authority in my organization, such as a supervisor, HR department, or a designated harassment officer.
5. I will consider consulting with a lawyer who specializes in employment law to understand my rights and the potential legal actions I can take.
