## In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting story was when Fogg illustrates how starting with very small, manageable actions can lead to substantial improvements over time. This approach contrasts with the common belief that big, dramatic changes are necessary for success. 

## How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A, and P.

If we want to change our life, we’ll have to change our behaviors. There are only three simple variables that drive those behaviors. That’s where the B=MAP model comes in. 
Motivation, or your desire to execute the behavior.
Ability, i.e. your capacity to execute the behavior.
Prompt, or your cue to execute the behavior.


## Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?

1. Small improvements and tiny choices compound over time: The speaker explains the concept of aggregation of marginal gains which means that small improvements of 1% each day can lead to significant improvements over time.
2. Celebrating small wins helps you develop a new identity. By celebrating the completion of habits, we are essentially celebrating the person you are becoming.

The most interesting story or idea for James Clear was the idea of aggregation of marginal gains. This idea is introduced through the story of Dave Brailsford and British Cycling.  British Cycling was a mediocre cycling team that had not won a single gold medal in over 100 years.

## What is the book's perspective about Identity?

Identity is the north star of habit change. This means that instead of focusing on achieving a specific outcome, we should focus on who we want to be. Our habits should reflect the person we view ourselves as.

## Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

The book Atomic Habits by James Clear argues that small changes can lead to remarkable results over time. It emphasizes that building systems and focusing on identity are more important than setting goals.
The book also argues that it is important to focus on identity rather than outcomes. This means that you should focus on becoming the type of person who does the things you want to do, rather than simply trying to achieve those things. 

## Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

The book Atomic Habits by James Clear, discusses how small habits can lead to remarkable results. One way to make a habit harder to do is to make it invisible, unattractive, difficult, and unsatisfying. Rather than focusing on goals, we should focus on systems. Instead of saying "I want to lose weight" (goal), we should focus on building habits that will lead to weight loss (system).

## Pick one habit that you would like to do more of. What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

One habit I'd like to do more of is daily meditation. Here are the steps to encourage this habit:
1. Set a specific time each day for meditation, like right after waking up.
2. Create a peaceful and inviting meditation space with calming elements like candles or soft music.
3. Use a meditation app with guided sessions to make the practice more engaging.

## Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of. What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

One habit I'd like to eliminate is checking my phone too frequently. Here are the steps I can take:
1. Keep my phone out of sight, such as in another room or in a drawer.
2. Turn off non-essential notifications to reduce the prompts to check them.
3. Implement apps that limit phone usage or lock certain apps after a set time.
